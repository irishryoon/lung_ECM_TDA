# Wholeslide analysis

* Contains code for assigning clusters to each tile (ROI) from a wholeslide image.

* The raw data (the wholeslide images, the image of the smaller ROI, and the PH features) isn't share due to the large size. Please contact Iris Yoon for data. 

* An exmple output is shown in `analysis_TDA`
